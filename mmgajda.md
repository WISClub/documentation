**Task:**
 1. Pass "the-explorer" application to Ben for Auth0 integration.
 2. Write Playwright test(s) to verify Auth0 implementation.
 3. Create testing setup structure where credentials and session information is secret.
 4. Incorporate testing to mock 2FA sign-in
 5. Collaborate with Ben on a "clean-slate" starter repo with instructions so anyone can pick up the project and go.

 **Progress:**
 1. Done as of `1/27/2024` - [repo here](https://github.com/bentzi-shuster/IS421) 
 2. Done as of `2/6/2024` Basic testing completed using secrets/env.local variables.
 3. Done as of `2/15/2024`  AuthState information is encrypted for repo and decrypted during Playwright initialization.  Encryption key is in Secrets.
 4. Work in progress.  I am hesitant to use my own phone number and haven't found a low cost alternative.
